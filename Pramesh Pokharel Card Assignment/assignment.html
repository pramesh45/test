                           Inclusive language
                       </h2>
                       <p> Inclusive language is language that does not belittle, exclude, stereotype or trivialise people on the basis of their race, gender or disability.At university there are a number of people from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds as well as people with disabilities, different sexual preferences and holding varied religious or spiritual belief systems. We all have a responsibility to respect these differences and ensure that our speech and language is appropriate and non-discriminatory.

                           Punctuation
                       </h2>
                       <p> Punctuation marks help you to organise your words into clauses and sentences, and hence into identifiable units of meaning. They are the signs that alert readers to the appropriate pauses in your text. These pauses signal where you intend the emphasis and intonation to be placed, and thus how you want the text to be read. Punctuation marks help you tell the reader how to find the meaning from your organisation of the words.

                           Quoting, paraphrasing and summarising
                       </h2>
                       <p> Any writing you do at university will require reference to recognised experts or authorities in that particular subject area (discipline), to give the thoughts, ideas and information in your assignment credibility. There are three ways of including the ideas of an expert in your text: quoting, paraphrasing, summarising. No matter what you choose to do, you must acknowledge the source of these ideas.
